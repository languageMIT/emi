we have VP, V, and P
highest pmi when 
VP == V (the verb always appears with its particle, e.g. "bandy about"),
or VP == P (the particle only ever appears with this verb, e.g. "leave behind")

The real question is, given the verb, how much are you expecting the particle?
This should incorporate "null particles", so the VP==P high-pmi cases are dubious.
The VP==V ones are also scary,
because they just mean that the verb never appears with any other particle.

What really matters isn't straight up pmi.
It's p(particle|true context) vs. p(particle|noisy channel context at distance d).
From that perspective, "out" in "show out" doesn't get monotonically better with distance.
You still need some licensor of "out".
We have p(out|show+particle) < p(out|V+particle).
We really want p(out|show+particle) vs. p(particle+out).
p(particle+out|V) will be extremely low. Many verbs don't ever predict a particle!
So this pmi will just about never be negative.
